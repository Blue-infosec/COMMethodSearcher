# COMMethodSearcher
This is a PowerShell script that searches through all COM objects and look for any methods containing a key word of your choosing.
This has caused some weird shit to happen because it's literally instantiating every registered COM object, so use at your own risk. Because of this, this isn't supported, so if one day you log into Windows and see Microsoft Word pop up 12 times shortly after you ran this script, then don't open an issue because I warned you. Godspeed.
